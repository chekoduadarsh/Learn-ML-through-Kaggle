​

This is the beginning of a new Tutorial Series which will take you through the Basics of Machine Learning and will give a touch and introduction to deeplearning!! In this tutorial, each segment will have an interactive Jupyter Notebook (Which runs in Kaggle), along with a infographics Image, This course will make sure that you can identify and understand a Machine Learning problem is given and you can design and apply solutions to them!! 

​
